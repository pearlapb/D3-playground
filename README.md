## D3 Practice

In this repo I'm just doing basic D3.js projects to learn it as I'm really interested in Data Visualisation.
I would eventually like to work on an app that displays Economic Data in an interactive way, but first I will use D3 to add cool looking statistics to my [MyFairFight](https://github.com/pearlapb/my-fair-fight) App!
